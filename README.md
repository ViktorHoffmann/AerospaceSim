# AerospaceSim
CLI aerospace simulation tool

_What does it do?_

This tool can calculate atmospherical pressure and temperature models
as well as a vehicles dynamic pressure, _while assuming an ideal gas_,
at different altitudes and speeds up to 100km.

_How does it do it?_

For the atmospheric models the barometric formula and atmospheric base temperatures are used.

WIP:
- Ascend pattern calculation
- Adjustable simulation properties and assumptions
- Proper UI
- Refined atmospheric models for real gases etc.
